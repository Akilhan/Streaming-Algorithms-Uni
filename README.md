Streaming algorithms implementation in cpp
- [ ] Count-Min Sketch algorithm:
     - In this code, I define a CountMinSketch class that encapsulates the Count-Min Sketch data structure. The increment function is used to increment the frequency of an element, and the estimateFrequency function      estimates the frequency of an element based on the counters in the sketch.To run this code, you'll need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Simply copy the code into a .cpp file, compile it, and run the resulting executable.
